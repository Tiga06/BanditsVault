# BanditsVault: Encrypt. Share. Self-Destruct.
A vault system that allows users to encrypt and share secrets like text, images, or videos via one-time-use secure links. Once the recipient views the content, it is selfdestructed forever, ensuring private and secure transmission of sensitive information
